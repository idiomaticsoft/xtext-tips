This is a small demonstration on how to add support for imported namespaces in Xtext.

# Contents

This folder contains 2 versions of the block project. 

- The folder `01start` contains the starting project, without the imported namespaces. 
- The `02end` folder contains the project with imported namespaces support.

# Explanation
